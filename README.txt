This app is basically the same as my other filecount app with the 
exception that this one has utilised PyQt and Qt4 to produce the GUI.

Written in Python3.2

In theory this should work under Windows but I have had some issues
with the \ due to how Python uses it.

Any problems, suggestions or questions please get in touch.

Edit (12-Aug-2012):
filecountQUERY will need to be changed to filecountQUERYv2 in filecountMAIN 
if you wish to use the new version which includes file size summing.
